# Personal Portfolio site
Personal portfolio site. it has a couple things like three.js, so I am using node.js to help build it.

Build and run
    npm install
    npm run dev


## Building for production
This is being hosted through Cloudflare currently. Running this command creates a "dist" folder.

    npm run build
